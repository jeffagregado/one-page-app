This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## One-Page App

This is a simple project to practice my html, css and js skill, with responsive design and without the use of Bootstrap. This is based on the template from [Free-CSS](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer).
